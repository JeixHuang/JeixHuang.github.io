Hi ü§ó, I'm Victor Shea-Jay Huang (Chinese: ÈªÑÂ∏åÊù∞(Xijie Huang); French: Victor Ch√©-Jay Huang).

<!-- I am a recent graduate from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) and is currently working as a research assitant intern at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), under the mentorship of Prof. [Wentao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JE4VON0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and advisement of Prof. [Bin Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IJAU8KoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  -->
## Research Interest

I have a strong interest in all topics related to AI integrated with natural scientific theories and am actively exploring and expanding the boundaries of current AI technology. My efforts are primarily focused on 3 directions: 
 
- **Trustworthy ML:** Identify and address critical challenges in trustworthy AI, focusing on improving interpretability, Safety, PrivacyÔºåetc. 

- **Natural Science:** Generalize theories from natural sciences to enhance model capabilities, including reasoning, generalization, and adaptability. 

- **AI+X:** Integrate insights with machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning for broader downstream applications.

I'm presently involved in academic collaborations with institutions such as [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/), [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), [SBU](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), [THU](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), [NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/), [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/), [ShLab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) ,and [Baichuan AI](https://www.baichuan-ai.com/home). If you are interested in joining the project or exploring collaboration opportunities, please reach out to me via email at jeix782@gmail.com.
