<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

Hi ü§ó, I'm Victor Shea-Jay Huang (Chinese: ÈªÑÂ∏åÊù∞(Xijie Huang); French: Victor Ch√©-Jay Huang).

I am an undergraduate student at [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), expected to graduate in 2026. Currently, I am working as a research assistant intern at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), under the mentorship of Prof. [Wentao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JE4VON0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and advisement of Prof. [Bin Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IJAU8KoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

## Research Interest

I have a strong interest in all topics related to AI integrated with natural scientific theories and am actively exploring and expanding the boundaries of current AI technology. My efforts are primarily focused on 3 directions: 
 
- **Trustworthy ML:** Identify and address critical challenges in trustworthy AI, focusing on improving interpretability, safety, privacy, etc. 

- **Science Augmented AI:** Generalize theories from natural sciences, such as geometry and biology, as well as social sciences, including organizational behavior and cognitive psychology, to enhance model capabilities in reasoning, generalization, and adaptability.

- **AI+X:** Integrate insights with machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning for broader downstream applications.

Welcome to my YouTube channel [@VSJH2003](https://youtube.com/@VSJH2003)! üéâ Here, I share my passion for the intersection of AI and natural sciences, with videos covering math, physics, AI, and cognitive psychology‚Äîjoin me for paper discussions, trending topic updates, and insights into my work as we explore the future of science and technology together!
